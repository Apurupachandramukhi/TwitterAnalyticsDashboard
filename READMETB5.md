## üìù Steps Implemented
1. **Duplicated Table**
   - Duplicated unpivoted table as `Task5_Unpivoted` to keep original dataset clean.

2. **Applied Dataset Filters**
   - Unpivoted Click Columns:
     - Selected `URL Clicks`, `User Profile Clicks`, `Hashtag Clicks`
     - Applied **Unpivot Columns** in Power Query
     - Resulted in:
       - `Click Type`: URL, Profile, Hashtag
       - `Click Count`: Numeric values
   - Even Date Filter:
     ```DAX
     IsEvenDate = IF(MOD(DAY('Task5_Unpivoted'[date]), 2) = 0, 1, 0)
     ```
